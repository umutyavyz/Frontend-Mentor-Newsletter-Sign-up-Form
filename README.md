# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter Signup Form with Success Message

This is my solution to the [Newsletter signup form with success message challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv).
It was built using **HTML5**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal was to create a fully responsive newsletter signup form that includes client-side validation and a success message state.

## üí° What I Learned

- Building a responsive layout that significantly changes between mobile and desktop (from a vertical stack to a two-column card).
- Implementing robust client-side email validation using JavaScript and regular expressions.
- Managing UI state by dynamically hiding the form and showing a success message.
- Passing data (the email address) from one UI state to another using JavaScript.
- Using Tailwind CSS utility classes, including responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`), to create complex and adaptive layouts.
- Styling for three distinct breakpoints (mobile, tablet, and desktop) and handling different images for each.
- Creating an accessible and user-friendly form experience.
